# Fraud-Detection-Using-ML
We have a dataset of more than 6 million data points with target data of a transaction being fraud or not. 
We need to create a model to predict the future transactions. Though the data is huge there were no missing values. There are both categorical 
and neumerical data.
It is a binary classification issue.
