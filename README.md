# Fraud-Detection-Using-ML
We have a dataset of more than 6 million data points with target data of a transaction being fraud or not. 
We need to create a model to predict the future transactions. Though the data is huge there were no missing values. There are both categorical 
and neumerical data.
It is a binary classification issue.
While working on Kaggle there are certain changes that we can apply to make this better ,but as the accuracy is already more than 99.8, we don't need to do that.
We will wait on this and make it better by just applying pipelines and to create a UI for the user.
